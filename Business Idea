Business Idea:
To implement voice assistant in grocery shops like D mart to assist user in finding out the 
offers available on different items and to locate the items from different queues in the shop.

Approach/Solution:
1.	The approach starts from gathering the required information on all the items like location and offers.
2.	Then we need to maintain all this data in a database.
3.	Implement the lambda function and integrate with database.
4.	Finally integrate lambda function with voice assistant.

Benefits/Advantages:
1.	Avoid manual intervention
2.	Fast and immediate locating of items
3.	Avoid sticking/labelling of new prices
4.	Limit the number of workers
5.	Save paper and effort by avoid pricing on each item
